		      <li>Defiant - Star Trek Deep Space Nine<br>
		      <img style="width: 50%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryeman2003/ryeman2003.github.io/master/EMSB-defiant.jpg"><br>
			      The Defiant was brought in to help in the fight with the Dominion in Star Trek DS9 season 3 episode 1. It was officially classified 
			      as an escort vessel but was unofficially a warship. It was a prototypt. It would have had no families, science labs, or any other luxuries and its original purpose was to 
			      fight the Borg. It wasn't used because the Borg threat beacame less urgent ad some design flaws that were fixed by Chief O'Brien. It is equipped with a cloaking device.
		      </li>
		      <li>Death Star - Star Wars<br>
		      <img style="width: 50%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryeman2003/ryeman2003.github.io/master/EMSB-death-star.jpg"><br>
			      It was capable of destroying planets with a single blast. The first was destroyed by Luke Skywalker and the second by Lando. The weakness of the first was the thermal
			      exhaust port.
		      </li>
		      <li>USS Enterprise - Star Trek The Original Series and The Next Generation<br>
		      <img style="width: 50%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryeman2003/ryeman2003.github.io/master/EMSB-uss-enterprise.jpg"><br>
			      Tere were multiple USS Enterprises. Captain Kirk was captain of the USS Enterprise in The Original Series and Captain Picard was captain of the USS Enterprise in The Next 
			      Generation.
		      </li>
		      <li>Deep Space Nine - Deep Space Nine<br>
		      <img style="width: 50%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryeman2003/ryeman2003.github.io/master/EMSB-ds9.jpg"><br>
			      Deep Space Nine was originally known as Terok Nor when under Cardassian occupation. It is located in the Alpha Quadrant near the wormhole. During the Cardassian 
			      Occupation, the Cardassians forced some Bajorans to work in the mining facilities on the station. 
		      </li>
		      <li>Starkiller Base - Star Wars<br>
		      <img style="width: 50%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryeman2003/ryeman2003.github.io/master/EMSB-starkiller-base.png"><br>
			      The weakness was the thermal oscillator. The Millenium Falcon destroyed the shield and the crew opened up a hole for Poe to destroy it. It could destroy multiple planets by
			      harvesting a sun. It shot multiple beams at the same time from a long range at the group of planets that are its targets. The only way to destroy it was to destroy the
			      thermal oscillator while it is fully charged and before it fires.
		      </li>
		      <li>Runabout - Star Trek<br>
			<img style="width: 50%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryeman2003/ryeman2003.github.io/master/EMSB-runabout.jpg"><br>
			      The runabout is a small vessel. Most are equipped with transporters but can land if needed. They can be used for attacks but is unadvised for attacking while alone. They're
			      better equipped for transporting small qroups of species, for reconnaissance, or for scientific research.
		      </li>
		      <li>X-Wing Fighter<br>
			<img style="width: 50%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryeman2003/ryeman2003.github.io/master/EMSB-x-wing.jpg"><br>
			      The X-Wing was a fighter that has been changed over the years. It has 4 wings(2 on each side). You can only see all 4 clearly when it's in attack position. Otherwise they
			      come together to look like 2 wings(1 on each side).
		      </li>
